          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>
            At PetMalu, we are passionate about improving the lives of stray
            animals and pet owners in the Philippines. Our platform was created
            to bridge the gap between those looking to adopt a pet and those
            needing reliable pet care services. By fostering connections and
            providing essential resources, we strive to make a positive impact
            on the community and promote responsible pet ownership.

          <p>
            At PetMalu, our mission is to revolutionize pet adoption and care in
            the Philippines by providing a user-friendly platform that connects
            loving homes with stray animals and reliable pet-sitting services.
            We aim to enhance animal welfare, reduce euthanasia rates, and
            promote responsible pet ownership through education and community
            support.

          <p>
            We envision a future where every stray animal finds a loving home,
            and pet owners have access to trustworthy care resources. By
            building a compassionate community, we aspire to create a safe and
            nurturing environment for all pets, fostering lasting bonds between
            animals and their families.
